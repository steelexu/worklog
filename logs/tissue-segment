To get brain atlas segmentation (https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00457 extension of this work) you don't need to run any code. Just sign up at brainchop.org, upload your 3T MRI T1 image and get brain atlas in 1-2 minutes.
 MeshNet is volumetric convolutional neural network based on dilated kernels [1] for image segmentation. Model has been trained for brain tissue segmentation from imperfect labeling obtained using FreeSurfer automatic approach
