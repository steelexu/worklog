Use of Human Connectome Project MRI techniques to map the effects of AD on brain connectivity
 As the disease progresses there are fewer connections between essential brain regions

*prediction/diagnose with D_learning + graph_model?

Deep learning algorithms can diagnose AD with greater than 95% accuracy
can diagnose MCI due to AD with greater than 82% accuracy

Deep learning algorithms which extract the most pertinent information from MRI scans can also predict the progression of MCI patients to AD several years in advance with accuracies of greater than 90%.

*Imputation of missing modalities
Using voxel-based 3D GAN, train a generator/discriminator convolutional neural network to generate synthetic FLAIR/T1 from T1/FLAIR to enable the use of complete datasets in instances of missing modalities. https://github.com/ravnoor/MRI-GAN
